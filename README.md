# Marlin for Artillery Sidewinder X2

The stock firmware on the Artillery Sidewinder X2 is [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin), however it is out of date (2.0.9.1) and missing some fairly basic features.

Marlin is an open source project in active development and so with a little configuration this can be made to run on any supported printer.

In this repository you will find a `Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h` which is exactly that.

You should also find scripts to download the latest supported Marlin, apply the configuration and build the firmware to flash onto your printer.
